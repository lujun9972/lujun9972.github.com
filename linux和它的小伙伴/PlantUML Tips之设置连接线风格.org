花图时，PlantUML默认使用曲线连接元素,不过我们可以通过 =skinparam= 的 =linetype= 参数对连接线的风格进行修改。

例如下面是默认的连接风格：

          customer -- order
          order -- ebook
          order--publisher

          (Cancel Order) as cancelOrder
          customer -- cancelOrder
          cancelOrder -- ebook
          cancelOrder--publisher
      }
  }

  (Ship To EBook) as shipEBook
  shipEBook -- publisher
  (Ship To Customer) as shipCustomer
  customer -- shipCustomer
  ebook -- shipEBook
  shipCustomer -- ebook

  (Return to EBook) as returnCustomer
  (Returnto Publisher) as returnPublisher
  customer -- returnCustomer
  returnCustomer -- ebook
  ebook -- returnPublisher
  returnPublisher -- publisher

  @endUML
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:./images/plantuml_deployment_nolinetype.png]]

  下面是设置了 =skinparam linetype ortho= 的样子
#+begin_src plantuml :file ./images/plantuml_deployment_linetype_ortho.png
