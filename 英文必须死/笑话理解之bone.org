#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Bambi the blonde celebrated her 40th birthday with a makeover. She went to the best plastic surgeon in town and got a boob lift, a tummy tuck, butt implants, botox, collagen... the works. Ten weeks and thousands of dollars later, she was a new woman - literally.

  Her personal physician then performed her annual physical, noted the new "body work."

  When the exam was finished, he called her in.

  "Bambi, your overall health is good, but I want to discuss a problem that often affects women your age, osteoporosis."

  Bambi looked puzzled, "Osteo-what?"

  "Bone loss. Many women start to experience it in their 40s."

  Bambi giggled, blushed and said, "Oh, really, Doc. You've seen me naked. Trust me, with this body and this face, I get new bones quite often!"
