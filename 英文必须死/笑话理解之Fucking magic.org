  David Copperfield is doing his magic show and asks if anyone would like to show him a trick.

  "I will", replies a guy in the audience, "but I'm going to need your wife Claudia and a table."

  "Ok", says David and the guy gets on stage.

  He then bends Claudia over the table, pulls down her knickers and starts f**king her from behind.

  David is now very pissed off and says, "That isn't a trick!!!"

  The guy just looks at David Copperfield and replies, "I know, it's fucking magic."
