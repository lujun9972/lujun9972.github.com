* scared devil out of people
#+begin_example
  Some ecclesiastical gentlemen -- a cardinal, a couple of bishops and some others -- were waiting outside the Pearly Gates for St. Peter to open up.

  He finally arrived, but just they were about to enter heaven St. Peter asked them to wait a moment and let a new arrival through first.

  A sweet young thing in a mini-skirt arrived and was ushered through.

  The cardinal was a bit upset about this and demanded an explanation from St. Peter. After all, they had been waiting outside for quite some time and were pillars of the church. How could a girl in a mini-skirt deserve better treatment?

  St. Peter smiled and told him, "While she was alive, that young lady drove a little yellow sports car. She regularly jumped red lights, overtook on blind corners, and generally scared the devil out of more people than all of you combined."
