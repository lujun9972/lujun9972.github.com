#+NAME: Hit The Ceiling
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Sister Mary burst into the principal's office and cried, "Father, just wait until you hear this!"

  "Calm down, Sister Mary. Now tell me what has you so excited?"

  "Well, Father, I was on my way to chapel when I heard some of the older boys wagering!"

  "A serious infraction, indeed!" said the priest.

  "But that's not what made me so excited, Father. It was what they were wagering on! They were betting to see who could urinate the highest on the wall!"

  "Incredible!!!" exclaimed the priest, "What did you do?"

  She said, "Father, I hit the ceiling!"

  He mused, "So how much did you win?"
