* Love Multiplication
#+begin_example
  Mrs. Johnson the elementary school math teacher was having children do problems on the blackboard that day.

  "Who would like to do the first problem, addition?"

  No one raised their hand. She called on Tommy, and with some help he finally got it right.

  "Who would like to do the second problem, subtraction?"

  Students hid their faces. She called on Mark, who got the problem but there was some suspicion his girlfriend Lisa whispered it to him.

  "Who would like to do the third problem, division?"

  Now a low collective groan could be heard as everyone looked at nothing in particular. The teacher called on Suzy, who got it right.

  "Who would like to do the last problem, multiplication?"

  Johnny's hand shot up, surprising everyone in the room. Mrs. Johnson finally gained her composure in the stunned silence.

  "Why the enthusiasm, Johnny?"

  "The Bible says to 'Go Forth and Multiply'!"
