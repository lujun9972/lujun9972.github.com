  Lena and Sven got married in St. Paul. They planned to honeymoon in Lena's aunt's cabin in Duluth. They caught a bus that was filled with deer hunters.

  About 30 minutes out of St. Paul the bus broke down right next to a nice hotel. Sven said to Lena, "Lena, there's a comfortable hotel right here. How about consummating our marriage?"

  Lena replied, "No. I vant to wait till ve get to Duluth."

  The repaired bus took off. Fifty miles down the road it broke down again. This time it was next to a good looking motel.

  Sven turned to Lena and asked, "Look Lena. There's a nice motel. Can ve consummate our marriage?"

  Lena said, "No. I vant to wait till ve get to Duluth."

  The bus was repaired and off they went. Ten miles down the road the bus broke down. This time they were out in the woods.

  However, there was a little clearing out of the sight of the bus.

  Lena turned to Sven, "I tink ve should go back into the voods and do it."

  Later when they returned the bus, Sven asked Lena, "Earlier ve vere next to a nice hotel and you said "No". Then, ve vere by a motel and yousaid "No". But, here ve vent out into the grassy voods and did it. Why?"

  Lena said, "I vas listening to the hunters. They said if the bus broke down again, the fucking season vould be over."
