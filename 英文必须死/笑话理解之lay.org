  Three Italian nuns die and go to heaven.

  At the Pearly Gates, they are met by St. Peter.

  He says, "Sisters, you all led such exemplary lives that the Lord is granting you six months to go back to earth and be anyone you wish to be.

  The first nun says, "I want to be Sophia Loren.." and *poof* she's gone.

  The second says, "I want to be Madonna and *poof* she's gone.

  The third says, "I want to be Sara Pipalini..."

  St. Peter looks perplexed, "Who?"

  "Sara Pipalini," replies the nun.

  St Peter shakes his head and says, "I'm sorry, but that name just doesn't ring a bell."

  The nun then takes a newspaper out of her habit and hands it to St. Peter. St. Peter reads the paper and starts laughing. He hands it back to her and says.

  "No sister, the paper says it was the 'Sahara Pipeline' that was laid by 1,400 men in 6 months."
