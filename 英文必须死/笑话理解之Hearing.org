* The Hearing Problem
#+begin_example
  In a church one Sunday morning a preacher said, "Anyone with 'special needs' who wants to be prayed over, please come forward to the front of the altar."

  With that, Peter got in line and when it was his turn the Preacher asked, "Peter, what do you want me to pray about for you?"

  He replied, "Preacher, I need you to pray for help with my hearing."

  The preacher put one finger of one hand on Peter's ear, placed his other hand on top of Peter's head, and then prayed and prayed and the whole congregation joined in with much enthusiasm.

  After a few minutes, the preacher removed his hands, stood back and asked, "Peter, how is your hearing now?"

  Peter answered, "I don't know. My hearing is actually next Thursday in the magistrate court."
