#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  A man gets up one morning to find his wife already in the kitchen cooking. He looks to see what she's cooking, and sees one of his socks in the frying pan.

  "What are you doing?" he asks.

  "I'm doing what you asked me to do last night when you came to bed very drunk," she replied.

  Completely puzzled, the man walks away thinking to himself, "I don't remember asking her to cook my sock..."
