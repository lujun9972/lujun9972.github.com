#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Father Murphy was playing golf with a parishioner. On the first hole, he sliced into the rough. His opponent heard him mutter "Hoover!" under his breath.

  On the second hole, the ball went straight into a water hazard.
  "Hoover!" again, a little louder this time.

  On the third hole, a miracle occurred and Fr. Murphy's drive landed on the green only six inches from the hole! "Praise be to God!"

  He carefully lined up the putt, but the ball curved around the hole instead of going in. "HOOVER!!!!"

  By this time, his opponent couldn't withhold his curiosity any longer, and asked why the priest said, "Hoover".

  "It's the biggest dam I know!"
