* Christmas Gift

#+begin_example
  Dirty Little Johnny climbs onto Santa's lap at the department store.

  Santa says, "I'll bet I know what you want for Christmas."

  And with his index finger he taps the boy on the nose with every letter he spells, "T-O-Y-S."

  The little boy answers, "No, I have enough toys."

  Santa tries again, tapping Johnny's nose with every letter, "C-A-N-D-Y."

  Again, Johnny says, "No, I have all kinds of candy."

  "Well, what would you like for Christmas?" Santa asks.

  Johnny replies, tapping Santa on the nose, "P-U-S-S-Y. And don't tell me you don't have any because I can smell it on your finger!"
