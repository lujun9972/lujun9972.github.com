#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  After only a year in Canada, a Polish man got married to a nice Canadian girl. They got along quite well until the day he rushed into his lawyer's office and begged him to arrange a quick divorce.

  The lawyer said, "What are the circumstances? Have you any grounds?"

  And the Polish immigrant replied, "Ja, ja, ve've got an acre and a half with a nice little house."

  "No, I mean, what is the foundation of your case?"

  "It's made of concrete."

  "Does either of you have a grudge?"

  "No, but we have a big carport."

  "I mean, what are your relations like?"

  "All my relations are in Poland."

  "Is there any infidelity in your marriage?"

  "Yes, we have high fidelity stereo and a CD player."

  "No, I mean, does your wife beat you up?"

  "No, I get up before her.` `Is your wife a nagger?"

  "What? No, she's white."

  `Why do you want this divorce anyway?"

  "She's gonna kill me. She's going to poison me."

  "Really? What makes you think so?"

  `I've got proof."

  "What kind of proof?"

  "She brought home a bottle from the drug store that says, 'Polish Remover!'"

=ground= 有 =土地= 的意思，但是也有 =根据，理由= 的意思。
因此律师问 =Have you any grounds?= 的本意是想问 =你有什么依据吗？= 但是波兰人以为他在问 =你有土地吗？=

类似的:

=foundation= 既有 =根据= 也有 =地基= 的意思

=relations= 既有 =关系= 也有 =亲戚= 的意思

=fidelity= 既有 =忠贞= 也有 =精确= 的意思, =fidelity stereo= 的意思是 =保真立体声=

=polish= 既有 =波兰人=,也有 =抛光剂(常用于美甲)= 的意思，因此 =polish remover= 其实是 =洗甲水= 的意思，但是被波兰人误解了..
